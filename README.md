# Pursuit-Core-iOS-File-Manager-Practice

Using the starter project here, build an app that pulls Rick and Morty Characters from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/) and loads them into a Table View.  You should persist the information (including images) to File Manager such that you don't need to make the API call more than once a week.
